# Data Science Skills Series

CSCAR will offer a series of workshops on data science skills using
Python.  The workshops will be held in the Earl Lewis room in the
Rackham building.  All workshops will take place on Wednesday
afternoons from 3:30-5.

The workshops are free and no registration is necessary.

We assume that participants are already familiar with basic Python.
People with no experience using Python but who are comfortable using
languages such as R or Matlab should also be able to follow the
presentations.

Feel free to bring a laptop, but it is not required.
