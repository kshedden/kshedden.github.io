<h2>The 2015 Data Mining Competition</h2>
<p>The Department of Statistics is sponsoring a data mining competition
open to all U-M undergraduates.  Individuals or teams are encouraged
to participate.</p>
<p>Each participant or team will analyze a data set (described further
below) and prepare a report.  The reports will be judged by a panel of
experts.  Prizes will be awarded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First place $500</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second place $300</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third place $200</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants are encouraged to think creatively when exploring the
data set, to identify an interesting, surprising, or insightful
finding based on the data.  This finding should then be carefully
described, interpreted, and justified using quantitative data analysis
methods.</p>
<h2>The data set</h2>

<h2>Contest rules</h2>
<ul>

<p>All reports must be submitted by email to Gina Cornacchia
  (ginalc@umich.edu) by 5PM on April 10th, 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most important judging criterion is to identify an interesting
  finding in the data, and to support and interpret it in an engaging
  and accessible way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each participant or team must submit one written report in PDF format.</p>
</li>

  the report.  A strong report will be focused and engaging to the
  reader, and should be readable by a non-expert data scientist or
  statistician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of advanced or specialized techniques will not necessarily be
  viewed as a strength.  If you choose to use advanced techniques be
  sure to motivate and explain the technique in an accessible manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of visualization (e.g. graphs and diagrams) is encouraged.
  Visual materials should be incorporated into the report if possible,
  but a separate file containing visual materials will also be
  accepted.</p>
