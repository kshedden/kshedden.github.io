<h2>The 2015 Data Mining Competition</h2>

<p>The U-M Department of Statistics is sponsoring a data mining
competition open to all U-M undergraduates.  Students may participate
in the competition either as individuals or as part of a team.</p>

<p>Each participant or team will analyze a data set (described further
below) and prepare a report.  The reports will be judged by a panel of
experts.  Prizes will be awarded as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First place $500</p></li>
<li><p>Second place $300</p></li>
<li><p>Third place $200</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When a team is awarded a prize, the prize amount will be divided
equally among the team members.</p>

<p>Participants are encouraged to think creatively when exploring the
data set.  The goal is to identify an interesting, surprising, or
insightful finding based on the data.  This finding should then be
carefully described, interpreted, and justified using quantitative
data analysis methods.</p>

<h2>The data set</h2>
