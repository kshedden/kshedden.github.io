The 2015 Data Mining Competition
--------------------------------

The Department of Statistics is sponsoring a data mining competition
open to all U-M undergraduates.  Individuals or teams are encouraged
to participate.

Each participant or team will analyze a data set (described further
below) and prepare a report.  The reports will be judged by a panel of
experts.  Prizes will be awarded as follows:

* First place $500

* Second place $300

* Third place $200

Participants are encouraged to think creatively




## The data set

All contestants will analyze a data set containing information about
over 100,000 "notable individuals".


## Contest rules

* All reports must be submitted by email to Gina Cornacchia
  (ginalc@umich.edu) by 5PM on April 10th, 2015.

* The most important criterion is to identify an interesting finding
  in the data, and to support and interpret it in an engaging and
  accessible way.

* Each participant or team must submit one written report in PDF format.

* There is no mandated page length, format, content or structure for
  the report.  A strong report will be focused and engaging to the
  reader, and should be readable by a non-expert data scientist or
  statistician.

* Use of advanced or specialized techniques will not necessarily be
  viewed as a strength.  If you choose to use advanced techniques be
  sure to motivate and explain the technique in an accessible manner.

* Use of visualization (e.g. graphs and diagrams) is encouraged.
  Visual materials should be incorporated into the report if possible,
  but a separate file containing visual materials will also be
  accepted.
