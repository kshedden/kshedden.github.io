__The next scheduled offering of this workshop is June 11-12, 2015
from 2-4 each day.  The workshop will take place in the 4th floor east
conference room of the Rackham Building.__

Information for participants:

+ The workshop will focus on the use of Python and the Statsmodels
library for regression analysis.

[Python data management
workshop](python_data_management_workshop.html) would proivde useful
background in preparing your data for analysis.

+ Materials from past workshops are provided below.  This site will be
