<h2>The 2016 U-M Undergraduate Data Mining Competition</h2>

<p>In the competition, you will analyze a dataset consisting of internet
routing "prefix announcements".  You can aim to identify faults or
possible malicious behavior present in the prefix announcements.  Or,
you can devise another goal, such as characterizing the prefix
announcements graphically or via a statistical model.</p>

<p>To obtain access to the data, send an email to <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x6b;&#115;&#x68;&#x65;&#100;d&#101;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x75;&#109;&#105;&#99;&#x68;&#46;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;">&#x6b;&#115;&#x68;&#x65;&#100;d&#101;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x75;&#109;&#105;&#99;&#x68;&#46;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;</a>`.
Although the data have been anonymized, routing table data and other
internet traffic data are in general somewhat sensitive.  Therefore,
you must not distribute these data files or use them for any purpose
other than this competition.</p>

<p>The data were provided for our use by researchers at
<a href="https://www.merit.edu/">MERIT</a>, a major network operator and research
organization based in Ann Arbor.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>We may provide more background information, sample code, or
hints here as the competition progresses.</em></p>

<p>You will need a very basic understanding of how internet routing works
to understand the data.  The main concept to understand is that the
internet is divided into subnetworks.  The major internet routers
(each of which handles huge volumes of traffic directed to many
thousands of users), communicate with each other to facilitate the
routing of packets of data over the network.  When a router is able to
handle data that is headed to a given subnetwork, it sends a "prefix
announcement" announcing this capability to the other routers.  This
is a dynamic process, at any point in time a router can announce that
it will accept traffic bound for any given subnetwork.</p>

<p>The data for the competition is two text files containing a two-hour
snapshot of "routing tables".  These tables capture a subset of the
prefix announcements sent by the the main internet routers.  It only
contains prefix announcements received by the MERIT network router,
which is the router handling traffic to U-M.  Each row in the data
files consists of seven fields separated by pipes.  We are only
interested in the data in fields 6 and 7.  Field 6 identifies a
specific subnet.  Field 7 is a sequence of router identifiers.  For
example, if field 7 contains the numbers</p>

<p>11164 4637 17444 55649</p>

<p>this means that router 55649 is announcing that it can now handle
traffic directed to the subnet given in field 6 of the same row.
After this prefix announcement is made by router 55649, it is then
picked up by routers 17444, 4637, 1164, and 237 in sequence.  Router
237 is the MERIT router and is not listed in field 7 of the data file,
although it is always at the end of the chain of messages.</p>

<p>You are welcome to analyze this data in any way you see fit.  However
the main motivation for choosing this particular segment of data is
that a routing error occurred at one point within this window of time.
One router incorrectly sent a prefix announcement indicating that it
could receive traffic from a network that is not supposed to handle.
You can try to detect this anomalous event, or identify a subset of
the data that is likely to hold the anomalous event.  We may give more
hints later, but for now this is all we are revealing about the
anomaly.</p>

<p>You can also focus your project on other goals, such as describing the
characteristics of prefix calls and the paths that they follow through
the main internet routers.</p>

<h2>Contest rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>All reports must be submitted by email to Gina Cornacchia
(ginalc@umich.edu) by 9AM on Monday, April 11th.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important judging criterion is to identify an interesting
finding in the data, and to support and interpret it in an engaging
and accessible way.</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant or team must submit one written report in PDF format.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no mandated page length, content or structure for the
report.  A strong report will be focused, coherent, and interesting
to read, and should be readable by someone who is not an expert data
scientist or statistician.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of advanced or specialized techniques will not necessarily be
viewed as a strength.  If you choose to use advanced techniques be
sure to motivate and explain each technique in an accessible manner.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of visualization (e.g. graphs and diagrams) is encouraged.
Visual materials should be incorporated into the report if possible.
A separate file containing visual materials will also be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions about the contest should be directed to Gina Cornacchia or
Kerby Shedden.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Prizes and judging</h2>

<p>The reports will be judged by a panel of experts.  Prizes will be
awarded as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First place $500</p></li>
<li><p>Second place $300</p></li>
<li><p>Third place $200</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When a team is awarded a prize, the prize amount will be divided
equally among the team members.</p>
