<h3>About Python</h3>

<p>Python is a general-purpose programming language.  It is used for many
purposes and was not developed specifically as a language for data
management and analysis.  However it works very well for that purpose.</p>

<p>Matlab, <a href="http://cran.org">R</a>, and <a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a> are
"domain specific languages" (DSL's).  They were specifically designed
for scientific computing and data analysis.</p>

<p>Python implementations exist for many platforms and hardware
configurations.  The core language and libraries behave in a highly
consistent way across a variety of platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS,
many others).</p>

<p>Python is not (and was not intended to be) an exotic or revolutionary
language.  It should seem obvious and natural to anyone familiar with
generic "pseudo-code".  It has a few distinguishing features, most
notably, the use of indentation rather than braces to define code
blocks.</p>

<h3>Python libraries</h3>

<p>Python itself is not very useful for scientific work.  However by
using Python together with some powerful libraries, many things become
possible.</p>

<p>Here are the libraries that we discuss in our workshops:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a>: data management</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://matplotlib.org">Matplotlib</a>: graphics and plotting</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net">Statsmodels</a>: statistical
models and data analysis tools</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.numpy.org">Numpy</a>: array processing and linear algebra,
provides matrix algebra functionality similar to Matlab and R (but
with some different syntax)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.scipy.org">Scipy</a>: numerical routines such as
integration, optimization, and special functions</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Numerical performance</h3>

<p>Python is an interpreted language like R and Matlab.  It is possible
to write code that runs reasonably quickly, but it is also possible to
write code that performs poorly.  There are many ways to write Python
code that both performs well and is easy to read and maintain.  One
general principle is to take advantage of libraries like Numpy that
are implemented in C.</p>

<p>It is possible to write C extensions to Python.  This is made
particularly easy by using a tool called <a href="http://cython.org">Cython</a>.
However, most users will rarely if ever need to use Cython.</p>

<h3>Python 2 versus Python 3</h3>

<p>The Python community is currently progressing through a transition
from the "2 series" Python implementations to the "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html">3
series</a>" Python
implementations.  Python 3 scripts may not run in Python 2, and Python
2 scripts may not run in Python 3.  Nearly all libraries have been
substantially modified to work in both Python 2 and Python 3, and this
process is now largely complete.</p>

<p>There are many small changes and a few large changes from Python 2 to
Python 3.  Many of these changes are of little consequence to most
users of Python for scientific purposes.</p>

<h3>Tools for working with Python</h3>

<p>The base Python interpreter has a simple command-line interface.  Many
powerful tools for working with Python scripts and interacting with
the interpreter have been developed.  These tools are surveyed here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a> -- a shell for working with Python
interactively.  This tool provides far more functionality than the
basic Python command line.  It can be run in a terminal (providing a
text-only interface), and it is a component of many graphical and
browser-based environments.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> (formerly known as the "IPython
notebook") -- cell-based manipulation of Python code, runs in a
browser.  This is an ineractive graphical environment that embeds
the standard text-based IPython command line.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html">Pdb</a> -- a debugging tool
built into many Python shells and IDE's</p></li>

<h1>Python installation</h1>

<h2>Installing from a distribution</h2>

<p>Installing Python and its scientific libraries from scratch is
possible, but is challenging and time consuming.  The easiest way to
get up and running quickly with Python is to either use a cloud
service, or to install a bundled distribution of the entire scientific
Python stack.  Here are some Python distributions that are suitable
for data analytic work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy">Enthought Canopy</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Continuum Anaconda</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">Python-xy</a> -- Windows only</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pyzo.org">Pyzo</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing Python from source</h2>

<p>If you use Linux or MacOS and have a working compiler like gcc in your
system, you can install core Python by first downloading the source
tarball (pythonxxx.tar.gz) from
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">www.python.org</a>, then following
these steps (change pythonxxx to the specific file name):</p>

<p><code>
tar --xz -xvf pythonxxx.tar.xz
cd pythonxxx
./configure
make
make install
</code></p>

<p>Note that you need to have root access on the machine to do this.  If
you do not have root access, it is possible to install everything in
an arbitrary location by replacing the configure step above with</p>

<p><code>
./configure --prefix=/path/to/location
</code></p>

<p>If you install Python in a non-standard location you will need to use
the full path to the executable to launch it (or make an alias in your
.bashrc or other shell configuration file).</p>

<p>Next you need to install each of the core libraries.  Briefly,
download an archive file for each library, e.g. numpyxxx.tar.gz, then</p>

<p><code>
gunzip numpyxxx.tar.gz
tar -xvf  numpyxxx.tar
cd numpyxxx
python setup.py install
</code></p>

<p>Note that the gunzip and tar steps may differ depending on the archive
format (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz, .zip).  The <code>python</code> command in
step 4 should invoke whichever Python installation on your system you
want to link to the libraries (i.e. if you have installed several
Pythons, you need to use the right one here).</p>

<p>An alternative way to install the libraries (but not Python itself) is
to use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>.  To install numpy, for
example, using pip, type <code>pip install numpy</code> into the command line of
your computer.  Note that you may have several Python distributions
installed on your machine.  Each distribution will have its own
directory tree and libraries, and its own copy of pip.  You need to
use the pip that belongs to the python installation you intend to work
with when installing libraries to be accessed by that installation.</p>

<p>If you are using Anaconda Python, you can use the command <code>conda</code> to
install packages, e.g. <code>conda install numpy</code>.</p>

<p><code>vitualenv</code> is a utility that allows you to easily maintain multiple
independent Python environments.  It is also useful if you want to
maintain only a single environment in a non-standard location.</p>

<h2>Installing on Windows using binaries</h2>

<p>If you use Windows and have administrator access to your system, you
can scour the web for the core language and various libraries in
self-extracting executable (*.exe) format, and install them by
running them (double click on the *.exe).</p>

<p>A good resource for up-to-date windows packages for Python is
<a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs">here</a></p>

<h1>Using Python for data analysis in the cloud</h1>

<p>Several services allow you to use Python without installing any
software on your own machine.  These services provide servers on which
the scientific Python stack is installed.  Users connect to these
services through a web interface, so all you need to use them is a
computer with a web browser.  Many people see this approach as the
future of scientific computing, but the current generation of cloud
computing services for scientific Python has some limitations.
Nevertheless, it is usable, especially for training and learning.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://try.jupyter.org">try.jupyter.org</a> this site requires no
sign-up but may not include a complete set of libraries.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com">Sage math cloud</a> -- this service
provides both the IPython notebook and their own notebook format.
In addition to Python, they provide R, C, Fortran, and several other
tools.  Currently all accounts are free.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.wakari.io">Wakari</a> -- a commercial service provided by
Continuum Analytics.  They provide free accounts, but these are
often unusable during busy times of day, and their free system is
too slow for most real analyses.  However it is quite useful for
learning, teaching, and training.  The system exclusively uses the
IPython notebook, and does not support languages other than Python.
It is fairly easy to configure your own environment (e.g. loading
non-standard Python libraries).</p></li>
<li><p>The SCS servers (scs.itd.umich.edu) -- a U-M internal service, the
"old school cloud" is a set of Linux servers.  To use this system,
you need to learn how to use ssh to connect to a remote machine, and
use terminal tools like text editors (Emacs or Vim).  These machines
currently lack an updated Python distribution with all the libraries
discussed here, but with some work it is possible to install
everything in "user space".</p></li>
